### Propertise

- ability to simulate a wide range of network technologies and protocols (wireless , Internet protocols, and routing protocols)
-  NS3 supports both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols 
-  models for various wireless technologies (WiFi, WiMAX, and LTE)
-  scalability (NS3 can simulate networks with thousands of nodes, making it suitable for large-scale network simulations)
-  The ability to simulate different types of traffic and network topologies, which makes it useful for evaluating the performance of complex networks under different conditions.
-  NS3 is an open-source tool, which means that its source code is available to the public, and users can modify it to suit their needs. This property allows researchers and developers to customize NS3 to meet their specific requirements and add new features and models to the simulator.
